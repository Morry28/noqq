**Intelligent queries at fractions of a penny instead of dollars.**

NOQQ is a lightweight, intelligent data querying system designed to handle massive CSV datasets quickly and affordably. It leverages the power of OpenAI to dynamically create efficient, precise data filters and retrieval functions directly from natural language prompts.

## Cost Comparison

Imagine you have a database file with **12 columns and 100,000 entities**, requiring the processing of approximately **2.5 million input tokens** per request.  

This is the actual cost comparison as of **March 2025**:

| Model        | Cost (USD) |
|--------------|------------|
| GPT-4.5      | $190       |
| GPT-4o       | $6.25      |
| GPT-4o-mini  | $0.37      |
| GPT-o1       | $37        |
| GPT-o1-mini  | $2.75      |
| **NOQQ**     | **$0.002** |

NOQQ provides an ultra-low-cost alternative to traditional LLM-powered queries, making large-scale data processing significantly more affordable.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install noqq
```

## Usage

Initialize NOQQ and query your CSV file effortlessly:

```javascript
import NOQQ from 'noqq';

const noqq = new NOQQ({
    openaiApiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY',
});

await noqq.initFile('./customerDB.csv');
const result = await noqq.query('return all users from Eritrea');

console.log(result);
```

## Features

- **No Query-Query:** Query your datasets using plain language.
